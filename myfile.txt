Once associated with a file name, we use our file stream to read each line of text from
and print it out on a screen. To do that, we declare a string variable s which will hold our
read line of text. Inside the while-loop, we read a line from a file to a string. This is why
the std::getline function accepts a file stream and a string as arguments. Once read,
we output the text line on a screen. The while loop terminates once we reach the end of
the file.
